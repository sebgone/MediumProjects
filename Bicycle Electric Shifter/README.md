# Bike Electric Shifter

The main assumption of this project was designing an electric bike shifter. System includes the most important elements to develop base assistance bike system.

## Technology:
* Arduino 
* CAD software

## Application:    
System consist of mcu unit, servomechanism, hall sensors, power distribution, main screen and shifter screen with controll butons, RTC circuit, modified front and rear derailleur.  
System enables to fast electronic gear shift, callibration all gears, display main information about bike and the battery supply is also connect to dynmo which cause system autonomic. 

## specificaton:
* Hardware:
    * two servos
    * modified derailleur
    * arrangement system elements
    * two hall sensors
    * Li-Ion supply
    * dynamo charging
    * user interface on the main screen
    * shifter screen and control buttons
* Software:
    * gears configuration and calibration
    * save user settings in eeprom
    * reset setting function
    * barttery indicator
    * actual date and time
    * three shifter modes (not programmed)
    * display speed and cadence
    * bibycle counter function (time, distance, average speed)
    * display front and rear gear position
    * display entire gear speed
